    <h2>How to Shrink the Wage Gap</h2>
    <p>Closing the gap will require multifaceted solutions that together help ensure that the work women perform is valued fairly and to achieve equality.</p>

    <br/>

    <ul class="resources">
      <li><a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/ff7b3d0b-bc00-4498-9f9d-3e56ef95088f/the-digital-divide-.pdf">1. Raise the minimum wage</a>. Raising the minimum wage will help hardworking women better support their families. While nearly two-thirds of mothers are breadwinners or co-breadwinners for their families, women made up approximately two-thirds of all minimum-wage workers in 2012.
</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/internet-access-poor-students">2. Raise the tipped minimum wage</a>.The gender wage gap is particularly prominent among tipped workers. The federal tipped minimum wage, which hasn’t been changed since 1991, only pays workers $2.13 per hour. According to the Economic Policy Institute, women make up two-thirds of tipped workers and are 70 percent of food servers and bartenders, occupations that comprise more than half of the tipped workforce.
</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2016/11/07/the-internet-as-a-human-right/">3. Support fair scheduling practices</a>. Women, especially women of color, are more likely to work in low-wage jobs and often have rigid, unpredictable schedules that can change with little notice, making it difficult for working parents—especially mothers—to anticipate their schedules and arrange for child care. These workers risk losing their job because they lack the flexibility to alter their schedules

    </ul>

		<h2>Call Your Senator</h2>

		<p>
			In early March 2020, the House passed a new version of
			<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4229/text"> H.R.4229 Broadband Deployment Accuracy and
				Technological Availability (DATA) Act.</a>. The goal of this bill is to improve how data is collected about where broadband
			does and doesn’t exist. Right now, the internet service providers self report on broadband coverage, but according to
			<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/bill-to-improve-fccs-broadband-mapping-for-rural-america-passes-house-again/">CNET</a>,
			“the FCC last year also called out Verizon, T-Mobile and US Cellular in a report for overstating their wireless coverage.”
			The government gives funding to areas without coverage, so it’s important to give them accurate information.
		</p>

		<br/>

		<p>
			Your action item today is to call your Senator to tell them about your access to broadband coverage and tell them to support
				<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4229/text">H.R.4229 Broadband Deployment Accuracy and
					Technological Availability (DATA) Act.</a>
